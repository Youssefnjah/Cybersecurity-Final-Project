# Cybersecurity-Final-Project

In this Project I played the role of a SOC Anylyst for X-corp. I set up alerts and Index pattern on kibana to monitor and log the attacks that I will be conducting soon after. After setting up the alerts I played the role of a pentration tester to try and exploit the Word Press Server as we will see. I then analyzed live traffic on Wireshark to find any abnormalities.

# Accomplishments

- Set up watcher alerts on Kibana and set up Index Pattern
- gained access to the Word Press server and found all four flags
- took note of vulnerabilities and ways to mitigat them
- anyalyzed live traffic through wireshark 

Work related to setting up alerts can be found in ![Blue Team](https://github.com/Youssefnjah/Cybersecurity-Final-Project/blob/main/Final%20Project%20Blue%20Team.pdf) file, work related to the attack and exploit of the Word Press server can be found in the ![Red Team](https://github.com/Youssefnjah/Cybersecurity-Final-Project/blob/main/Final%20Project%20Red%20Team.pdf) file. Work related to traffic analyzed on wireshark can be found in the ![Network Analysis](https://github.com/Youssefnjah/Cybersecurity-Final-Project/blob/main/Network%20Analysis.pdf) file.
